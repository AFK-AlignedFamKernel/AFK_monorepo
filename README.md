## Overview

Decentralized social built with Nostr and powered by Starknet account abstraction.

## Origin story

The name "Aligned Fam Kernel" is inspired by our vision to align the web3 family together, in one Social graph. 

We build and fight together, not against. What if the treasure are the friends we made along the way? Then A decentralized social network should be a treasure trove of memories and connections!

Yes! This is what social networks should be about. A place where you can be yourself, express your thoughts and feelings, and connect with others.

Freedom requires censorship resistance, and Nostr provides exactly that.

- Typescript for the Nostr relayer - [Learn Typescript now](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/basic-types.html)

## Roadmap

- [x] Cairo implementation of Nostr signature verification
- [x] Starknet account contract implementation, controlled by Nostr keypair
- [ ] AFK landing page 
- [x] SocialPay feature to send and receive tips through Nostr signed messages
- [x] Implement a full Nostr client application with Starknet integration
- [x] Run Nostr relay server
- [ ] Crossover with [Vault](https://github.com/keep-starknet-strange/vault) to bring Social features to the Vault application

## Architecture

### Tips
There are two alternatives: WalletConnect, one which expects Nostr users to set up oridinary Starknet wallet like Argent or Braavos, and so called SocialPay which uses custom Account Abstraction contract based on bip340 signature scheme (Nostr native).

#### Wallet Connect
##### Tip to a recipient that never accepted the tip and don't have an account on SN
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Alice
    actor Bob
    participant backend as Backend
    participant transfer as Deposit Contract
    participant erc20 as ERC20
    
    Note over Alice,erc20: Alice tip is escrowed by the Deposit Contract
    activate Alice
    Alice->>erc20: approve(Deposit Contract, x)
    Alice->>transfer: transfer(Bob Nostr Address, x)
    transfer->>erc20: transferFrom(Alice, Deposit Contract, x)
    transfer->>Alice: deposit_id
    deactivate Alice


    Note over Alice,erc20: Bob claims the tip with his Nostr identity
    activate Bob
    Bob->>backend: claim(deposit_id)
    Note right of Bob: deposit_id is signed<br/> with Nostr key
    backend->>transfer: claim(deposit_id)
    transfer->>erc20: transferFrom(Transfer Contract, Bob, x)
    deactivate Bob 
```

##### Tip to a recipient that earlier accepted the tip
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Alice
    participant transfer as Deposit Contract
    participant erc20 as ERC20
    
    activate Alice
    Alice->>erc20: approve(Deposit Contract, x)
    Alice->>transfer: transfer(Bob Nostr Address, x)
    Note left of transfer: Deposit Contract knows<br/> Bob's SN address
    transfer->>erc20: transferFrom(Alice, Bob, x)
    deactivate Alice
```

#### SocialPay

##### Alice sends tokens to Bob

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Alice
    actor Bob
    participant SocialPay gateway
    participant Starknet Node
    participant Alice Account
    participant STRK Token

    Alice->>SocialPay gateway: @AFK send 10 STRK to @bob
    activate SocialPay gateway
    SocialPay gateway->>Starknet Node: SocialPay transaction
    Starknet Node->>Alice Account: SocialPay handler
    Alice Account->>STRK Token: transfer
    Starknet Node->>SocialPay gateway: SocialPay transaction complete
    SocialPay gateway->>Bob: @bob you just received 10 STRK from @alice
    SocialPay gateway->>Alice: @alice transfer of 10 STRK to @bob is complete
    deactivate SocialPay gateway
```

## Modules

<details>
  <summary>Onchain</summary>

The onchain components of the project are implemented as a suite of Starknet smart contracts.

### Build

To build the project, run:

```bash
scarb build
```

### Test

To test the project, run:

```bash
snforge test
```

</details>

## Mobile

The AFK Mobile app is built with React-native & Expo.
[Current version](https://app.afk-community)


Pick an issue with the labels "mobile" to start work on React-native and contribute!

### Test

AFK Aligned Fam Kernel is born from this open source project.

Now we keep building and move forward!
