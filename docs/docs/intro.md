*AFK is a Decentralized social built with Nostr and powered by Starknet account abstraction*.

## Origin story

The name "Aligned Fam Kernel" is inspired by our vision to align the web3 family together, in one Social graph.

We build and fight together, not against. What if the treasure are the friends we made along the way? Then A decentralized social network should be a treasure trove of memories and connections!

Yes! This is what social networks should be about. A place where you can be yourself, express your thoughts and feelings, and connect with others.

Freedom requires censorship resistance, and Nostr provides exactly that.
